        HAMLET

HAMLET  O, I die, Horatio;
        The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
        I cannot live to hear the news from England;
        But I do prophesy the election lights
        On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
        So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
        Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

        [Dies]
